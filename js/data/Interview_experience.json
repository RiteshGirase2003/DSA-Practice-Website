        "Article": "I recently went through the interview process at RSquareSoft, which consisted of three rounds. The first round focused on general aptitude, where I encountered questions related to Java, DSA, OOP, SQL multiple-choice questions, as well as quant, logical reasoning, puzzles, and simple algebra questions. In the second round, which was technical, I was asked to write code in any programming language to manipulate strings. One question required changing the sequence of words in a string; for example, given the input 'javascript is best', the output should be 'best is javascript'. Another question involved writing a function to return unique characters from two given strings, where s1 = 'abcdde' and s2 = 'achj', resulting in the output 'bdehj'. Additionally, I was tasked with finding the sub-matrix with the highest number of 1s in a given matrix. Other questions included finding the first repeating character in a string and the first non-repeating character. The interview experience was rigorous but rewarding, challenging my coding skills and requiring a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures. The interviewers were supportive, emphasizing the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in the tech industry. I was excited about the opportunity to work with RSquareSoft and contribute to their projects, as the process not only assessed my technical abilities but also gave me a glimpse of the collaborative environment I could be part of."
